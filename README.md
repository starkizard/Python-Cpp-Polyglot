# Python-Cpp-Polyglot
A python script that can be used to make a file that runs on both python interpreter and c++ compilers

A polyglot (meaning multilingual) is a file that is read differently but different interpreters/compilers . Check out [mitra](https://github.com/corkami/mitra) For an awesome polyglot generator.

Unfortunately , the tool doesn't have .py or .cpp support. So this is a script that takes two files ( a python file and a cpp file) as input and generates a polyglot, maintaining the functionalities of both the files. 

### USAGE
python3 PythonCppPolyglotMaker.py [Output file name] [Input py file] [Input cpp file]
